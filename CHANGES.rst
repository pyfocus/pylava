0.0.0 (2018-08-15)
==================

This is not an actual release. This version represents the point at
which Pylava was forked from Pylama.

Pylava was forked from the ``master`` branch of Pylama version 7.4.3
(commit c38d598 dated 2017-09-17 +0300). This commit is tagged as 0.0.0.

Thus Pylava 0.0.0 is equivalent to Pylama 7.4.3.
